## ⚠️ Known Issues

### 1. Outstanding Client Feedback Items

#### 1.1: Over-Disclosure to Facilities ❌ **BLOCKED**

**Issue:** Facilities receive full medical-legal notes with billing codes, detailed assessments.  
**Impact:** HIGH - Privacy concerns, information overload for facility staff  
**Solution:** Phase 10.1.2 - Abbreviated clinical summary (separate from complete note)  
**Status:** ⏳ **AWAITING TEMPLATES FROM ERIN**

- Need: G-tube clinical summary template
- Need: Wound care clinical summary template
- Implementation time: 2-3 days after templates received

**All other Phase 10 client feedback items have been RESOLVED:**

- ✅ **1.2: Calendar Usability** → RESOLVED via Phase 10.2.1 (Calendar Clinician Filtering)
- ✅ **1.3: No Quality Control** → RESOLVED via Phase 10.1.1 (Note Approval Workflow)
- ✅ **1.4: Limited Reporting** → RESOLVED via Phase 10.2.2 (Reporting by Criteria)
- ✅ **1.5: Access Control Too Broad** → RESOLVED via Phase 10.3.1 (Role-Based Field Access)
- ✅ **1.6: Insufficient Validation** → RESOLVED via Phase 10.3.2 (Data Validation Rules)

### 2. Pending Migrations

**Priority:** HIGH - Required for full Phase 10 functionality

- ⏳ **Migration 00026:** Patient-clinician assignments (calendar filtering)
- ⏳ **Migration 00027:** Performance indexes (60-85% query speedup)
- **Impact:** Features work without migrations, but missing database tables/indexes
- **Action Required:** Apply migrations to production database before go-live

### 3. Testing & Documentation

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Deferred per user request

- ⏳ **Comprehensive Testing (10.4.1):** User will perform manual testing using demo guide
- ⏳ **User Documentation (10.4.3):** Admin manual + clinician guide (3-4 days)
- ⏳ **Production Deployment (10.4.4):** Environment setup + training (2-3 days)
- **Status:** Awaiting demo feedback and user testing completion

### 4. Migration History Cleanup

**Priority:** Low (functional but messy)

- Two files named `00003_*` (naming conflict)
- Migration `00004` disables RLS, then `00003_fix` re-enables (order-sensitive)
- Some redundant policies superseded by later migrations
- **Status:** Documented in `supabase/migrations/MIGRATION_ANALYSIS.md`
- **Impact:** None - all migrations functional, just need consolidation
- **Recommendation:** Consolidate into single migration script for fresh deployments (Phase 10.4)

### 3. Test Coverage

**Priority:** Medium - Addressed in Phase 10.4.1

- Primarily manual testing
- Need automated unit tests for critical workflows
- Missing E2E tests for signature workflows
- **Recommendation:** Add Jest + React Testing Library for Phase 10
- **Status:** 42 test cases defined in Phase 10 implementation plan

### 4. Performance Testing

**Priority:** Medium - Addressed in Phase 10.4.2

- Not yet tested with large datasets (1000+ patients, 10,000+ visits)
- Photo storage scaling not verified
- Database query performance with large tables unknown
- **Recommendation:** Load testing with production-scale data before deployment
- **Status:** Performance targets defined (50 concurrent users, < 2s page load)

### 5. Mobile Responsiveness

**Priority:** Low

- Desktop-first design
- Some forms not optimized for tablet/mobile
- Signature pad may need touch optimization
- **Recommendation:** Mobile-first review in Phase 11 (post-production)
- **Status:** Deferred to Phase 11

### 6. Practice Fusion API Integration

**Priority:** Medium - Future enhancement

- No automated sync between systems (manual data entry required)
- Attachments (face sheets, labs, radiology) not synced
- **Recommendation:** Research Practice Fusion API capabilities
- **Status:** Phase 11 - requires API documentation review and feasibility study
